### II. Purpose and Function Description of the Agent Code

#### 1. **Purpose Description**

1. **Remote Command Execution**:

   - Receives and executes remote commands via AWS SQS queues, suitable for scenarios requiring remote control or automated task processing.
2. **Automated Task Processing**:

   - Automatically processes tasks in the queue, such as log collection and data processing.
3. **Learning and Demonstration**:

   - Serves as an example for learning AWS SQS and the Boto3 library, helping developers understand how to interact with AWS SQS using Python, including receiving, sending messages, and executing commands.

#### 2. **Function Description**

1. **Initialize AWS SQS Client**:

   - Initializes the AWS SQS client using the `boto3` library, specifying the region as `eu-north-1`.
2. **Receive Messages**:

   - Receives messages from the specified receive queue `receivequeue_url`, with a maximum of 1 message received at a time.
3. **Execute Commands**:

   - Executes the received commands using the `subprocess` module and captures the command output or error messages.
4. **Send Results**:

   - Sends the execution results of the commands to the specified send queue `sendqueue_url`.
5. **Delete Processed Messages**:

   - Deletes the processed messages from the receive queue after command execution and result transmission.
6. **Continuous Operation**:

   - Runs in an infinite loop, checking the receive queue every 5 seconds to continuously process new messages.
